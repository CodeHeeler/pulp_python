=============================
pulp-python 3.0 Release Notes
=============================

pulp-python 3.0 is currently in Beta. Backwards incompatible changes
might be made until Beta is over.

3.0.0b3
=======

* Add support for project specifier whitelisting.

  Sync now takes in a project specifier of project name, version, and digest.
  In the previous implementation a project list would be given on PythonRemote creation,
  sync downloaded every package of all the projects in the list::

        projects=['django', 'scipy']


  This is still possible in the new implementation like so::

        projects=[{"name": "django"}, {"name": "scipy"}]


  But it is now also possible to sync only certain versions of projects, and to sync only
  packages matching a given hash::

        projects=[{"name": "django", "version_specifier":"~=2.0"},
                  {"name": "scipy",
                   "digests":[
                        {"type": "md5",
                         "digest": "044af71389ac2ad3d3ece24d0baf4c07"},
                        {"type": "sha256",
                         "digest": "18b572502ce0b17e3b4bfe50dcaea414a98290358a2fa080c36066ba0651ec14"}]
                  }
                 ]
